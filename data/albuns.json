It was released May 20, 1997 through Roswell/Capitol Records.\n\nThe album was the debut of the Foo Fighters as a band, as frontman Dave Grohl had recorded all of the first album by himself with the exception of one guitar part by Greg Dulli. The Colour and the Shape was produced by Gil Norton, who was perhaps best known for his work with the Pixies. It was loosely conceived by Grohl as a concept album which documented the beginning and end of a romantic relationship. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "2451": {"MBID": "fd262f0e-5a81-4945-9033-71127c7bc3d5", "Title": "Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes,+Silence,+Patience+&+Grace", "ID": 2451, "Image": "None", "ArtistID": 46, "Artist": "Foo Fighters", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "2452": {"MBID": "f1346b7c-0f76-362e-b81c-4e6935cb537d", "Title": "One by One", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One", "ID": 2452, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/ed840b1232244813bc66df0f1dfff9c8.png", "ArtistID": 46, "Artist": "Foo Fighters", "Date": "None", "Description": "Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album.

The album, which was released on November 22, 2012, is Keys' first release with RCA Records following Sony Music Entertainment's decision to close J Records during a company reshuffle. Girl on Fire was conceived shortly after Keys' marriage to record producer and rapper Swizz Beatz as well as the birth of her first child Egypt. The title track became the album's lead single, and has peaked at eleven on the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/Girl+on+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "3905": {"MBID": "905f63c8-fac6-4b82-ad99-e3163cffcfda", "Title": "Unplugged", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/Unplugged", "ID": 3905, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/3e6c161a13e34624c6310837f8a86127.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3906": {"MBID": "None", "Title": "As I Am - The Super Edition", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/As+I+Am+-+The+Super+Edition", "ID": 3906, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/66cd54468f69427baec307aa48902a67.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3907": {"MBID": "None", "Title": "The Life (Sampler)", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/The+Life+(Sampler)", "ID": 3907, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/25b581a7a2b44dbe88b8368d52eb73bf.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3908": {"MBID": "None", "Title": "Songs in A Minor (10th Anniversary Edition) (Deluxe Edition)", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/Songs+in+A+Minor+(10th+Anniversary+Edition)+(Deluxe+Edition)", "ID": 3908, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/31e1185343b2449eb430fea4f4cb555d.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3909": {"MBID": "None", "Title": "Diary of Alicia Keys", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/Diary+of+Alicia+Keys", "ID": 3909, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/ec6407b4211e4738bc87e6b2147102f8.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3910": {"MBID": "None", "Title": "The Element Of Freedom (Deluxe)", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/The+Element+Of+Freedom+(Deluxe)", "ID": 3910, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/7cecf9ca15f94d909ae85280c7fd265f.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3911": {"MBID": "None", "Title": "In Common", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/In+Common", "ID": 3911, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/72fa7cd8f299774bc3a48bb72c2e66c4.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3912": {"MBID": "b3def2f0-7450-3bf7-ba39-de5227fcbfe9", "Title": "Doesn't Mean Anything", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/Doesn%27t+Mean+Anything", "ID": 3912, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/79e99c70f0684bbdbfa23ea60be0d113.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3913": {"MBID": "e4021cc7-c6a4-41e3-b03a-0b70736b33c3", "Title": "We Are Here", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/We+Are+Here", "ID": 3913, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/66e391d64434438ac34e800f84c77dd3.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3914": {"MBID": "None", "Title": "HERE", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Alicia+Keys/HERE", "ID": 3914, "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/558f6b699656e1df9f9c0a30797d967e.png", "ArtistID": 75, "Artist": "Alicia Keys", "Date": "None", "Description": "Here is Alicia Keys' sixth studio album after a four years hiatus following her Grammy Award winning album Girl on Fire.
