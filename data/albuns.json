Formerly titled Daydreamin', the album was released on August 30, 2013 through Republic Records. Incorporating R&B, pop and soul, Yours Truly was influenced by Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey amongst other of Grande's idols. Grande describes the album's first half as a \"throwback\" to the R&B music of the 1990s, and the second half being \"very unique and very special that I've sort of written\" which is completely original. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/Yours+Truly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.", "Title": "Yours Truly", "MBID": "e32719b7-0528-479c-992e-1b5ec4ebbb4a", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/975b6224803a49429561f0135e33c54d.png", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/Yours+Truly"}, "2236": {"Date": "2014-08-25", "Artist": "Ariana Grande", "ID": 2236, "ArtistID": 10, "Description": "My Everything is the second studio album by American recording artist Ariana Grande.
