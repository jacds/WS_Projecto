This album was a means to end the legal contract, before Mark Knopfler began his solo career (still signed to Mercury). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/Live+At+The+BBC\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "2367": {"Title": "Dire Straits / Communique", "ArtistID": 154, "Date": "None", "ID": 2367, "Artist": "Dire Straits", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/Dire+Straits+%2F+Communique", "Genres": [], "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/3541300d4e944471b18b7326c1310161.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "2368": {"Title": "Making Movies (Remastered)", "ArtistID": 154, "Date": "1980-10-17", "ID": 2368, "Artist": "Dire Straits", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/Making+Movies+(Remastered)", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/f455df0f08af4978c997c6e74349a361.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "2369": {"Title": "Walk of Life", "ArtistID": 154, "Date": "None", "ID": 2369, "Artist": "Dire Straits", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/Walk+of+Life", "Genres": [], "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/b506f386274844eeb14d0ed1fd12e6fc.png", "MBID": "340a40c3-3a9a-4bd9-90b4-06919484cd71", "Description": "None"}, "2370": {"Title": "Brothers In Arms - 20th Anniversary Edition", "ArtistID": 154, "Date": "None", "ID": 2370, "Artist": "Dire Straits", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/Brothers+In+Arms+-+20th+Anniversary+Edition", "Genres": [], "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/7a7387527c911d983086a57c91414113.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "2371": {"Title": "The Best Of - Private Investigations", "ArtistID": 154, "Date": "2005-11-15", "ID": 2371, "Artist": "Dire Straits", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits/The+Best+Of+-+Private+Investigations", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/3af3caf323f7430caff59270549a5571.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "Private Investigations: The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler is a compilation album by Dire Straits and British singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler, released in 2005 by Mercury and Vertigo internationally, and Warner Bros. in the United States.

Musically, Title was inspired by Trainor's love for throwback style records, and the 1950s and 1960s eras in music. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/Title\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "3304": {"Title": "No", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "None", "ID": 3304, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/No", "Genres": [], "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/f79abd49a22adf74b46643f3537fb732.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3305": {"Title": "Thank You (Deluxe)", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "2016-05-13", "ID": 3305, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/Thank+You+(Deluxe)", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/673f4bc8422714624c968027bf6da24d.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3306": {"Title": "I'll Be Home", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "2014-11-17", "ID": 3306, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/I%27ll+Be+Home", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/f13248bbeab445ebc5957c215d619586.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3307": {"Title": "Spotify Sessions", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "2015-02-27", "ID": 3307, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/Spotify+Sessions", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/648b089d0d714b3ccb95cfa76dc173dd.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3308": {"Title": "(null)", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "None", "ID": 3308, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/(null)", "Genres": [], "Image": "None", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3309": {"Title": "Better When I'm Dancin'", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "2015-10-14", "ID": 3309, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/Better+When+I%27m+Dancin%27", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/bca47f0f621e3cdcf27c3a1c72d55291.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3310": {"Title": "Title (Special Edition)", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "2015-11-20", "ID": 3310, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/Title+(Special+Edition)", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/19e2e2d1eec1ba44ae7be444374b75c6.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3311": {"Title": "All About That Bass - Single", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "None", "ID": 3311, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/All+About+That+Bass+-+Single", "Genres": [], "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/829a5612814647f2c78ed95e2cf111ef.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3312": {"Title": "I'll Be Home For Christmas", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "None", "ID": 3312, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/I%27ll+Be+Home+For+Christmas", "Genres": [], "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/3848bc00c4704367c362af7d57da3a49.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "None"}, "3313": {"Title": "Thank You", "ArtistID": 155, "Date": "2016-05-13", "ID": 3313, "Artist": "Meghan Trainor", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Trainor/Thank+You", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/d58d5d697878abf9bb0a34ead3cb723d.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "Thank You is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor.

The lyrical themes deal with subjects related to modern British club culture and partying, as well as relationships and personal character problems. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/Think+Tank\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "3355": {"Title": "Blur: The Best Of", "ArtistID": 118, "Date": "2000-10-30", "ID": 3355, "Artist": "Blur", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Blur/Blur:+The+Best+Of", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/f3e8228a4e284e02b61dbf832dbc8cdb.png", "MBID": "e640ff45-e487-46f7-97b7-3a49523fe258", "Description": "None"}, "3356": {"Title": "Leisure", "ArtistID": 118, "Date": "1991-08-26", "ID": 3356, "Artist": "Blur", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Blur/Leisure", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/7d575e597c0844cda0469a971fb484b7.png", "MBID": "5834ce7b-007f-4e47-84bb-b4b66a6bdabf", "Description": "None"}, "3357": {"Title": "Modern Life Is Rubbish", "ArtistID": 118, "Date": "1993-05-10", "ID": 3357, "Artist": "Blur", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Blur/Modern+Life+Is+Rubbish", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/9ed3bb405cd44092820652fe6d8ba2fe.png", "MBID": "51765fea-8989-415a-b7cc-7370ffd85b9e", "Description": "Modern Life Is Rubbish is the second album by English alternative rock band Blur, released in May 1993.

It was loosely conceived by Grohl as a concept album which documented the beginning and end of a romantic relationship. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "4251": {"Title": "Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace", "ArtistID": 63, "Date": "2007-09-25", "ID": 4251, "Artist": "Foo Fighters", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes,+Silence,+Patience+&+Grace", "Image": "None", "MBID": "fd262f0e-5a81-4945-9033-71127c7bc3d5", "Description": "None"}, "4252": {"Title": "One by One", "ArtistID": 63, "Date": "2002-10-22", "ID": 4252, "Artist": "Foo Fighters", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/ed840b1232244813bc66df0f1dfff9c8.png", "MBID": "f1346b7c-0f76-362e-b81c-4e6935cb537d", "Description": "Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album.

The best example is the song \u201cWaters of Nazareth,\u201d which does not sound like disco when you listen to it for the first time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Justice/Cross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "4751": {"Title": "Justice", "ArtistID": 169, "Date": "2016-02-19", "ID": 4751, "Artist": "Justice", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Justice/Justice", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/d23e600fd4e943d5b63f2c3cc9b6bc73.png", "MBID": "4c280b71-7438-428e-9f4d-c8d9cb1b48a6", "Description": "None"}, "4752": {"Title": "Audio, Video, Disco.", "ArtistID": 169, "Date": "2011-10-24", "ID": 4752, "Artist": "Justice", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Justice/Audio,+Video,+Disco.", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/c26491eab52f4ca68a55f14830ff1a6f.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": " <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Justice/Audio,+Video,+Disco.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."}, "4753": {"Title": "\u2020", "ArtistID": 169, "Date": "2016-11-18", "ID": 4753, "Artist": "Justice", "URL": "https://www.last.fm/music/Justice/%E2%80%A0", "Image": "https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/174s/cffa3f4be5af470980e0c0b2963b466b.png", "MBID": "None", "Description": "\u2020, alternatively known as Cross, is the debut album of the French electro house duo Justice, released on June 11, 2007.\n\nTrack listing\n01. \"Genesis\" \u2013 3:54\n02. \"Let There Be Light\" \u2013 4:55\n03. \"D.A.N.C.E.\" \u2013 4:02\n04. \"Newjack\" \u2013 3:36\n05. \"Phantom\" \u2013 4:22\n06. \"Phantom Pt.
